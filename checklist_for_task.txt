Getting Started Checklist for the Homework

Plan by drawing a relationship diagram
Set up your directory structure
Create a Ruby file for each of your classes (remember singular names!)
Write your class definitions in each file (including an initialize)
For example:

class Team
  
  def initialize(name)
    @team_name = name
  end

end
Design your database tables
Create your database
Make a .sql file and write some SQL to create your tables
Run the .sql file (psql -d data_base_name -f file_name.sql)
Create an SQLRunner class that we can use to pass SQL strings to
Implement save, update and delete methods on your classes
Create console.rb to create some new objects and save them to the db
